# Forking, Cloning, and Creating a GitHub Pages Site

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Go to the following repository: [Cassandra's GitHub Workshop](https://github.com/cassandra-hui/GitHub-Workshop.git).
2. In the top-right corner, click the **Fork** button. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository to Your Computer

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.
2. Click on your current Repositoy (top left) > **Add** > **Clone Repository...**.
3. Select the repository you just forked from the list of repositories available to you. If it is still not showing navigate to the respository you just created under your username and click **Code** > **Open in GitHub Desktop**.
4. Choose a local directory where you'd like to store the repository, and click **Clone**.
5. Select the **Use for my own purposes** option. 

## Step 3: Create Your GitHub Pages Repository

1. Go to your GitHub profile and click the **+** button in the top-right corner, then select **New repository**.
2. Name the repository as **username.github.io**, replacing "username" with your GitHub username (e.g., `johnDoe.github.io`).
3. Set the repository to **Public** and click **Create repository**.
4. Clone this new repository to your local machine using **GitHub Desktop** the same way you did in Step 2.

## Step 4: Edit README.md

1. Open the `README_Template.md` from the forked **GitHub Workshop** folder.
2. Copy the tempate and add the content to your `README.md` file in your **username.github.io** folder.
3. Edit the `README.md` to fit your page. 

## Step 5: Copy the Website Template

1. On your computer, open the cloned folder for the GitHub Pages repository (`username.github.io`).
2. In another window, open the folder for the cloned **GitHub-Workshop** repository.
3. Navigate to the **Templates/Website Template** folder in the **GitHub-Workshop** repository.
4. Copy all the files (e.g., `index.html`, `about.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, images) from the **Website Template** folder.
5. Paste these files and images folder into the cloned folder for your GitHub Pages repository.

## Step 6: Edit the Website Template

Now youâ€™ll edit the template to personalize your website.

1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.
2. Replace `NAME` and `TITLE` in the hero section with your own name and title. For example:
    ```html
    <h1>John Doe</h1>
    <p>Data Scientist</p>
    ```
3. Customize the **About Me** section with your own information in both `index.html` and `about.html`.
    ```html
    <p>This is a paragraph about me!</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph about me!</p>
    ```
4. Add links to any projects or content you'd like to showcase.

### Changing the Images

5. To change the profile picture or other images in your template:
   1. Replace the existing image file(s) in your repository (e.g., `me.jpg` or `unr.jpg`) with your own image files. Make sure the new images have the same file name as the originals, or update the file paths in `index.html` accordingly.
   2. If you want to change the profile picture, locate the following part of the `index.html` file:
       ```html
       <img src="me.jpg" alt="Image of Me">
       ```
       Replace `"me.jpg"` with the name of your new image file (e.g., `"myphoto.jpg"`), and ensure the image is uploaded to the repository.
   3. Similarly, if you want to change the background image in the hero section, update this line in the CSS file (`style.css`):
       ```css
       .hero {
           background: url('unr.jpg') no-repeat center center/cover;
       }
       ```
       Replace `'unr.jpg'` with your desired image file (e.g., `'mybackground.jpg'`), and make sure the image is uploaded.

6. Save your changes to `index.html` and `style.css`.

## Step 7: Publish Your GitHub Pages Website

1. After editing the files, save your changes.
2. In **GitHub Desktop**, go to your **username.github.io** repository and you should see the modified files listed under **Changes**.
3. Add a commit message (e.g., "Personalized website with templates").
4. Click **Commit to main**.
5. Click **Push origin** to push your changes to GitHub.
6. Your website will be live at `https://username.github.io` within a few minutes.

## Done!

You've successfully forked a repository, cloned it to your computer, created a GitHub Pages site, copied over a website template, personalized the information, and published your site online.
