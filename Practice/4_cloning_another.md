# Cloning and Syncing Another Person's Repository

In this activity, you will clone another student's repository, make changes in your own repository, and update the cloned version to reflect those changes. 

## Step 1: Clone Another Student's Repository

1. On GitHub.com, go to the repository of another student (your partner) that you want to clone.
2. Click the **Code** button (green button) you can copy the repository URL under the HTTPS option and manually enter it or click on **Open with GitHub Desktop**.
3. Check the **Local Path** location is where you want the new file to be located.
4. Click **Clone**.

You now have a local copy of your partner's repository.

## Step 2: Make Changes to Your Own Repository

1. Open your own repository (that your partner has cloned) in **GitHub Desktop**.
2. Make changes to your local files (e.g., update the `README.md`, add a new file, or modify an existing file).
3. Save your changes.
4. In **GitHub Desktop**, commit your changes with a message describing the update (e.g., "Updated README.md with new content").
5. Push the changes to GitHub by clicking the **Push origin** button.

## Step 3: Sync the Changes from the Other Student’s Repository

1. Your partner should also have made changes now.
2. On **GitHub Desktop**, go to the local clone of your partner's repository.
3. Click **Fetch origin** to check for updates.
4. If updates are available, click **Pull origin** to sync the latest changes from your partner's GitHub repository to your local clone.

## Step 4: Verify the Synced Changes

1. After pulling the updates, check the local files in your cloned copy of your partner’s repository.
2. Verify that the changes your partner made are now reflected in your local clone (e.g., updated files or newly added content).

## Done!

This workflow demonstrates how you can clone and stay updated with public repositories, even if you're not a direct collaborator.
